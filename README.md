When you've downloaded the essentials, go ahead and clone/download this repository.

If you're using Laravel Valet as your development environment, make sure that the downloaded repository is in your serving sites  directory.

Fire up your cmd of choice and navigate to the sites directory. Type `npm run watch`, it'll auto refresh any changes made to `.scss` files in the `/scss` directory. The generated / finished `.css` files can be located in the `/css` directory.

All done! 🎉 Visit `stefanmiodrag.com.[.dev]`, by default, Valet serves your projects using the `.dev` extension.
